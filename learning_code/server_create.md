We recommend you install Node using either curl or wget.

1. To install NVM using curl, run the following command:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
```

2. To install NVM using wget, run the following command:
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
```
Note
You can also install NVM using GIT or with a manual download and installation. Consult the GIT section of the NVM Documentation Guide for detailed instructions.
Source the new instructions NVM added to .bashrc during the installation process. You can either exit and re-enter the shell console, or manually source your .bashrc file. This file is almost always located at the root of your home directory.

```
source ~/.bashrc
```
